        Publicis Groupe is a French multinational advertising and public relations company, and is the oldest and one of
        the largest marketing and communications companies in the world, by revenue, headquartered in Paris.

        After 1945, the little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth-largest
        agency.[when?] It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the
        advertising industry; it was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government,
        its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing
        industries.[3]

        It is one of the "Big Four" agency companies, alongside WPP, Interpublic and Omnicom.[4] Publicis Groupe S.A. is
        headed by Arthur Sadoun, and its agencies provide digital and traditional advertising, media services and
        marketing services (SAMS) to national and multinational clients.

        Ernst & Young Global Limited, commonly known as Ernst & Young or simply EY, is a multinational professional
        services network with headquarters in London, England.[6] EY is one of the largest professional services
        networks in the world.[7] Along with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, it is considered one of the
        Big
        Four accounting firms. It primarily provides assurance (which includes financial audit), tax, consulting and
        advisory services to its clients.[8] Like many of the larger accounting firms in recent years,[9] EY has
        expanded into markets adjacent to accounting, including strategy, operations, HR, technology, and financial
        services consulting.[10]

        EY operates as a network of member firms which are structured as separate legal entities in a partnership,
        which
        has close to 300,000 employees in over 700 offices in more than 150 countries around the world.[5] The
        firm's
        current partnership was formed in 1989 by a merger of two accounting firms; Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young
        &
        Co.[11] It was named Ernst & Young until a rebranding campaign officially changed its name to EY in
        2013,[12]
        although this initialism was already used informally prior to its sanctioning adoption.

        In 2019, EY was the seventh-largest privately owned organization in the United States.[13] EY has
        continuously
        been ranked on Fortune magazine's list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For for the past 21 years, longer
        than
        any other accounting firm.[14]

        Microsoft Corporation (/ˈmaɪkroʊsɒft/ MY-kroh-soft) is an American multinational technology company with
        headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer
        software,
        consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Its best known software products are the
        Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge
        web
        browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup
        of
        touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest
        United
        States corporations by total revenue;[3] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2016.[4]
        It
        is considered one of the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry, along with Google,
        Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.

        Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"[5]) was founded by Bill Gates and Paul
        Allen
        on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the
        personal
        computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's
        1986
        initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an
        estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified
        from
        the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the
        acquisition
        of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[6] followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for
        $8.5
        billion in May 2011.[7]

        As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office
        software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to
        Android.[8]
        The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops,
        tabs,
        gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN),
        mixed
        reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).

        Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.[9] This
        unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[10] entering the personal computer production market
        for
        the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later
        forming
        Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took
        over
        as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move
        that
        helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December 1999.[11][12]
